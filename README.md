<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

<!-- [![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com) -->

Cricket is amongst the most popular and quickly growing sports in the world, with players of 
all age groups and genders taking part. However, playing cricket has so far been difficult since
most cricket players cannot afford good facilities. Several individuals with a passion and 
enthusiasm for cricket cannot afford comprehensive cricket training due to financial reasons 
and a lack of trainers in small towns and rural areas. Many people are spending a huge amount 
of money on coaching to receive cricket training. That shouldn't be an excuse for anyone with 
a strong desire to play cricket to pass up any opportunities. Although this has opened up several 
research opportunities for enhancing methods for autonomously learning cricket, there's been 
practically little work being done in this timeframe. The focus of this study is on cricket players' 
batting abilities. To address this problem, the author developed an innovative way to help 
cricket players improve, guide, and track their performance while performing cricket strokes. The proposed project will play a significant role in minimizing the incompetence of many 
players and inspiring them to start coming forward to try to break the limitations and 
restrictions. The goal of this study is to create a system that uses human body critical points 
collected with Media Pipe to categorize cricket strike images. The application "CricTrack" was 
created with far greater capabilities in mind than any other research presently in use. In 
addition, a method with similitude has been proposed for matching the individualâ€™s cricket shot 
with likely images of standard cricketers batting shots of the same type, obtain the most similar 
one, and provide a detailed output describing their performances. The proper mobile 
application solution will assist players in improving stroke accuracy, as well as allow cricket 
players to evaluate, enhance, and monitor their striking performances without any need for 
training.
